# GETbaseballstats
I created a webscraper that scrapes just under the  top 50 MLB players from ESPN, then creates a CSV file to store it. I will add a simple csv reader as well. ## Every time you run the code, it updates the csv file (If anything changed) ##
# I also created a code that wrote the algorithm for me so I didn't have to retype the same things. I will also link that cause...Why not
