**NO NEED TO MAKE A CSV FILE, it will already make one for you, and every time you run the script after that, it won't keep remaking the same file as long as it detects a file**
I created a webscraper that scrapes just under the  top 50 MLB players from ESPN, then creates a CSV file to store it. I will add a simple csv reader as well. `` Every time you run the code, it updates the csv file (If anything changed) ``
# I also created a code that wrote the algorithm for me so I didn't have to retype the same things. I will also link that cause...Why not
